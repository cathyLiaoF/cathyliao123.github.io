## _Generative Adversarial Nets_ and _Variational Auto-Encoders_

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cathyliao123/cathyliao123.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### What are GANs?

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is a deep learning model and one of the most promising methods for unsupervised learning on complex distributions in recent years. The model produces a fairly good output through (at least) two modules in the framework: Generative Model and Discriminative Model.

The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters,
trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is
analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives
both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine
articles.

### Intro to VAEs
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cathyliao123/cathyliao123.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
